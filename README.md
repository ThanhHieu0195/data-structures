## About the Course
"Introduction to Databases" had a very successful public offering in fall 2011, as one of Stanford's inaugural three massive open online courses. 
Since then, the course materials have been improved and expanded, and all materials are available for self-study. 
Students have access to lectures with in-video quizzes, multiple-choice quiz assignments, automatically-checked interactive programming exercises, 
midterm and final exams, a discussion forum, optional additional exercises with solutions, and pointers to readings and resources. 
Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the curriculum draws from Stanford's popular Introduction to Databases course. 
The material presented here is the same as the corresponding material presented on Stanford's Class2Go platform.
