## About the Course
"Introduction to Databases" had a very successful public offering in fall 2011, as one of Stanford's inaugural three massive open online courses. 
Since then, the course materials have been improved and expanded, and all materials are available for self-study. 
Students have access to lectures with in-video quizzes, multiple-choice quiz assignments, automatically-checked interactive programming exercises, 
midterm and final exams, a discussion forum, optional additional exercises with solutions, and pointers to readings and resources. 
Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the curriculum draws from Stanford's popular Introduction to Databases course. 
The material presented here is the same as the corresponding material presented on Stanford's Class2Go platform. 

## Why Learn About Databases?
Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. 
Databases reside behind a huge fraction of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, 
video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. 
In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and 
convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. 
Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most 
useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.
